## 🧩 How It Works

1. User enters the name of a dish or ingredient.
2. The app sends a request to the [TheMealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php):
3. Matching recipes are displayed as interactive cards.
4. Clicking a card opens a **popup modal** showing:
- 🧾 Ingredients
- 📋 Cooking instructions
